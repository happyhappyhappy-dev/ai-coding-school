- Time-to-value specific ("learn in X weeks")

### Color Psychology for Education

#### Best Colors for Kids + Parents Combined

**Primary Recommendations:**

1. **Blue + Green Combination** (Most Popular)
   - Blue: Trust, focus, calm, professionalism
   - Green: Growth, harmony, mental clarity
   - Why works: Balances parent's need for credibility with kid's need for engagement
   - Examples: Duolingo, Code.org, Toppr, Academia.edu
   - Hex codes:
     - Deep blue: #0077B6 (Code.org-style)
     - Forest green: #2A9D8F
     - Light blue/green: #90E0EF, #A8DADC

2. **Blue + White** (Clean, Professional)
   - Why works: Maximum readability, academic credibility
   - Best for: Older students (12+), test prep, advanced courses
   - Examples: Academia.edu, many university sites

3. **Neutral + Accent** (Balanced Approach)
   - White/light grey background
   - Blue or purple as primary
   - Orange/yellow/green for CTAs
   - Why works: Professional + energy
   - Hex codes:
     - Background: #F6F6F6, #FFFFFF
     - Primary: #4A90E2 (blue), #5B4B8A (purple)
     - Accent CTA: #F94144 (coral), #F9C74F (yellow)

#### Colors by Age Group
